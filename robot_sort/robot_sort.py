        I should be able to implement variation on the bubble sort with what I have. 
        Pick up, move right and compare, swap if I need to, move left to put block back, move right.
        The light can be used to determine if I've swapped something in the current iteration.
        To keep things optimal, I can run the robot left to right, swapping anything that needs to be swapped up.
        Then when it hits the far right, go back to the left and swap things down as I go left.
        To determine if I need to move left or right, write helper methods that have their own while loops until they're at the end.
